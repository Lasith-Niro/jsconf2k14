- Stack based
> No variables, all state is placed on an implicit stack
--
- Reflective
> Programs can read and write their own source code
--
- Multi-dimensional
> Programs consist of single-character commands on a grid, and an instruction pointer moving between these
--
- Described as “a cross between Forth and Lemmings”
> Which is fairly apt
--
- Super annoying
> As will become obvious in a moment
--
- Completely useless
